As a Data Scientist @Shopbrain, my role (of course my senior and mentor role as well) was to create a model to beat the Forecasting baseline which was **FB Prophet**.
This method was used to train more than 9 million rows (Which are time series menu items in different restaurants) with more than 70 features.
This code and this Repo is only for how to train the LGBM model on a big size dataaset (There are other way of course but I'm talking about batch training LGBM).
